NSWillBecomeMultiThreadedNotification<br/>
Posted when the first thread is detached from the current thread. 
The NSThread class posts this notification at most once—the first time a thread is detached 
using detachNewThreadSelector:toTarget:withObject: or the start method. 

NSThreadWillExitNotification<br/>
An NSThread object posts this notification when it receives the exit message, before the thread exits.

<li>方法1：<br/>
{% highlight Objective-C %}
+ (void)detachNewThreadSelector:(SEL)selector toTarget:(id)target withObject:(id)argument;
{% endhighlight %}

 Detaches a new thread and uses the specified selector as the thread entry point.
 
 For non garbage-collected applications, the method aSelector is responsible for setting up an autorelease pool for the newly detached thread and freeing that pool before it exits. 
 Garbage-collected applications do not need to create an autorelease pool.
 
 The objects aTarget and anArgument are retained during the execution of the detached thread, then released. The detached thread is exited (using the exit class method) as soon as aTarget has completed executing the aSelector method.
 
 If this thread is the first thread detached in the application, this method posts the NSWillBecomeMultiThreadedNotification with object nil to the default notification center.

    /**
     In a reference-counted environment, releases and pops the receiver; 
     in a garbage-collected environment, triggers garbage collection if the memory allocated since the last collection is greater than the current threshold.
     
     In a reference-counted environment, this method behaves the same as release. 
     Since an autorelease pool cannot be retained (see retain), this therefore causes the receiver to be deallocated.
     When an autorelease pool is deallocated, it sends a release message to all its autoreleased objects. 
     
     If an object is added several times to the same pool, when the pool is deallocated it receives a release message for each time it was added.
     In a garbage-collected environment, release is a no-op, so unless you do not want to give the collector a hint it is important to use drain in any code that may be compiled for a garbage-collected environment.
